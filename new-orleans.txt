New Orleans

First thing I did was look for main

main:
	call create_password
	puts "Enter the password..."
	call get_password
	call check_password
	tst r15 ; the return value of check_password
	jnz to our win condition

so the next thing I did was look into check_password, because it might be comparing to a stored value

check_password:
	clr r14 						; empty out the counter(?)
	mov r15, r13 					; r13 = r15
	add r14, r13					; r13 = r13 + r14
	cmp.b @r13, 0x2400(r14)			;
