First thing I did was look for main

main:
	call create_password
	puts "Enter the password..."
	call get_password
	call check_password
	tst r15 ; the return value of check_password
	jnz to our win condition

so the next thing I did was look into check_password, because it might be comparing to a stored value

check_password:
	clr r14 				; empty out the counter(?)
	mov r15, r13 				; r13 = r15
	add r14, r13				; r13 = r13 + r14
	cmp.b @r13, 0x2400(r14)			; comparing the first byte of r13 with [r14+0x2400] (indirect displacement?)
	jnz $+0xc				; if compare fails, return 0
	
create_password is right above check_password in memory, so I noticed r15 is set to 0x2400, and indexed byte by byte with ASCII values with the indirect displacement addressing mode

64-22-5d-25-4e-25-45-00

d"]%N%E is the password!
password changes each time?
