main:
	sets r14 and r15 to 0x4520
	r14 = 0xf8
	r15 = 0x2400
	call enc
	call 0x2400
	clear r15

enc: 
	a complex series of instructions that affects memory on the stack,
	specifically after 0x2400

breaking at INT doesn't work here?
password is stored at 0x43da

0x2400:
	after enc, we can see b012 1000, which is call #0x10 at 0x2474
	this is the int for printing each character
	after input is taken, return to 0x43d2

0x43d2:
	cmp #0x656f, -0x24(r4) which is 0x43fe - 0x24 = 0x43da, where the password is stored

entering 6f65 is the password
