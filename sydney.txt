New info is that the password is no longer hidden in memory

first thing I do is break at main
main:
	calls get_password
	calls check_password
	after check password, we see the check to jump to the win
	
let's check get_password
get_password:
	mov 0x64, r14 ; assuming this is the argument for getsn(), this would mean taking 64 characters for a password
	call getsn
	ret

let's check check_password
check_password:
	compare 0x0(r15) with 0x3d63
	jump if not equal to set ret to 0
	compare 0x2(r15) with 0x6136
	it looks like the password is still here
	
	r15 is supposed to be 3d-63-61-36-3f-61-7d-25 or =ca6?a}%
	
for some reason, 0x0(r15) is set to 0x439c before the other bytes. How do I change the location it checks?
