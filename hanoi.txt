judging by the overview details, there's a comparison that involves setting a flag in memory
break at main
main:
	call login
	ret

login:
	puts out that passwords are between 8 and 16 characters
	sets r14 to 0x1c and r15 to 0x2400 before calling getsn
		is that normal? I have to check previous challenges to see
	calls test_password_valid
		if it returns 0, jump to the cmp.b command
		if not 0, set the byte at 0x2410 to 0x8e first
	compares the byte at 0x2410 with 0x11

so we need to make sure that test_password_valid returns 0
0x11 isn't a regular character, so we're gonna use hex encoded input

test_password_valid:
	calls int #0x7d on r14 and r15

sent 16 41's, and then 11, and it worked

the check was for the byte 0x10 bytes after the start, compared with 0x11, so I sent it as the 17th byte
